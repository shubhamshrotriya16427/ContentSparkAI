### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `my-backend` directory and add the following variables:
```
PORT=5005
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/local
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
REDDIT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/reddit-callback
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_reddit_user_agent
```
Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

### Step 4: Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd ../my-app
npm install
```

### Step 5: Set Up Frontend Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `my-app` directory and add:
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5005
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

### Step 6: Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd ../my-backend
npm start
```

### Step 7: Start the Frontend Development Server

Cleanly done, looks professional, and you actually did all the assigned tasks.
// I think your the only group which didn't miss anything, least thus far :p

Your tasks are coherent, and the pacing is correct for finishing a real project.
The tests are well phrased and can actually be tested.

Honestly, impressive work folks.

If you'd like me to look into anything more deeply I can.
But it looks like everything is under control.


6/6
